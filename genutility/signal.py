    Any KeyboardInterrupt received within the context manager will be caught and possibly
    re-raised at the end of the block. It can be used to make sure that sensitive code is not
    carelessly interrupted in the middle of execution by the user. The process could still be
    kill though, so this method should only be used as a convenience function, not to implement
    atomic transactions.
